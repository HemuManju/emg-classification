In this study, we predict the task difficulty during physical human-robot interaction using the EMG recordings. Predicting task difficulty aids in adapting the robot's behavior during pHRI. A robot can use the predicted task difficulty level to alter the damping level such that the effort of the human operator reduces. However, the damping level should not decrease to a level at which the robot motion becomes unstable. Hence, the level of damping should be maintained such that the human operator's effort is low and the robot motion is stable. To study such interaction, we design an experiment in which the subjects guide a robot under admittance control through a predefined trajectory.  Task difficulty can change by varying the damping level in the admittance control and the trajectory from gross to fine.  During the whole experiment, we record EMG and use it to predict whether the level of task difficulty in co-manipulation. We take two approaches to classify task difficulty from EMG data. First, feature extraction approach, second, a Riemann geometry approach and third, a deep convolution neural network (CNN) approach. The results show that the CNN approach performs consistently better than the rest in prediction the level of task difficulty.
